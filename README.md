# JGL
A simple Java game engine. JGL will set up a window and get your code running without you needing to deal with the JFrame setup or code timing. JGL helps keep your code uncluttered by forcing a separation of update logic and rendering logic. Both update code and rendering code run at 60hz, but they are never run at the same time, meaning that you don't have to worry about thread safety at all. Once JGL gets your window set up, you can write your game using the Graphics2D object passed to you, which is definitely capable of rendering a simple 2D game.
